# Eight-Queens-Problem

</div>

This repository contains the solution for a programming assessment completed in 2022, as part of the CS2004 Algorithms and their Applications module.

### Description

This individual programming assignment focuses on developing a set of Java functions to solve the classic Eight-Queens problem using a heuristic search algorithm. The Eight-Queens problem involves placing eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).

The assessment required implementing various components of a heuristic search technique. A key aspect of the solution is representing the chessboard and queen placements using a 24-length binary string. The fitness of a solution is determined by a fitness function that calculates the number of non-attacking queen pairs. The ultimate goal is to find a configuration where the fitness is maximized, indicating no queens are attacking each other.

The assignment involved creating methods to:

    Validate board characters and the overall board structure.

    Convert a board representation to its binary string equivalent.

    Generate initial random starting points for the search.

    Calculate the fitness of a given solution.

    Implement a "small change" operator to modify a solution (e.g., flipping a random bit in the binary string).

    Develop a class that encapsulates a single-population heuristic search algorithm to solve the Eight-Queens problem, integrating the previously developed methods.



### Purpose/Function

The primary purpose of this assessment was to apply knowledge of algorithms and their applications, specifically focusing on heuristic search algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems. The project demonstrates the ability to design, implement, and test a computational solution to a well-known combinatorial problem using programming best practices. It also served to deepen understanding of concepts like fitness functions, solution representation, and iterative improvement in the context of search algorithms.
